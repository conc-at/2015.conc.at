Asynchronous messaging provides machine-to-machine communication for microservices or any other kind of distributed architecture - and it offers much more than a simple action trigger: Parallelizing computing-heavy tasks, load testing, or migrating existing components to new services are some of the possibilities.

When a web application grows, its backend often evolves into a distributed application. Communication between components becomes crucial. Real life examples are used to illustrate when and where (not) to use asynchronous messaging and how it nicely complements a REST API. A variety of different use cases are explored, including some less obvious ones. Lessons learned from working on a web application with more than 14M users are shared, but we're also going to discuss how smaller applications can benefit from asynchronous messaging.
