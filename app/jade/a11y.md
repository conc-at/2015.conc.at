There are a great number of accesibility issues that can hinder people from attending an event. As it is our main goal to have an inclusive event with a welcoming atmosphere, we are trying hard to remove these barriers. 
If there is something that keeps you away from this conference [please get in touch](mailto:contact@conc.at) with us so we can work this out.
