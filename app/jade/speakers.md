We carefully selected our first seven speakers to show you in which direction we want the conference to go. There are **ten more 20min slots** *without Q&A session afterwards* so we invite you and the entire web development community to **propose a talk for .concat()**.

This is a web development conference, so we want to hear talks about frontend and backend development, security, design, typography, accessibility, open source and our culture.
But if you think our attendees will benefit from you hacking on robots or talking about [bacon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRVUKCQw7qU) that’s totally fine as well. 

Just remember: We will always favor an original, outside of the box talk, or one that explains concepts and the bigger picture over a “A sucks, use B instead” talk. Get creative and surprise us.

No matter if you’re an experienced speaker or a newcomer who has never spoken at a conference before: **We are interested in what you have to say**. We aim for a **diverse lineup with a fine selection of topics**, that come from everywhere out of this community.

You feel like you don't have anything to talk about? We feel you – we all know this feeling, but **we’re here to help you**.
